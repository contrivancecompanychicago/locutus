# Locutus (of Borg)

*Serverless functions that enable various home automation tasks via voice, text, CRON and external service integration.*

This app exposes a simple web API for querying prayer times (in the islamic tradition) by space and time. See an example of the deployed app **[here](https://8ldbpgh8mh.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/location/40.7128/-74.0059)** (<strong><a href="https://mottaquikarim.github.io/PrayerApp/docs/index.html" target="_blank">Docs here</a></strong>). This app leverages the **[praytimes.org](http://praytimes.org/manual)** project to cacluate prayer times. It is worth noting that the version of the **praytimes.org** library used here requires a patch due to a python scope issue (not sure how to push that patch back upstream, the project seems largely abandoned).

This app is built and tested with Python3.6 and deployed to AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework through Travis CI. We 
use Codeclimate to keep track of maintainability and test coverage.

There are currently no limitations on API usage on the `/prod` endpoint, which is CORS enabled (therefore, possible to use with frontend javascript). This policy will remain if and until there is a good reason to restrict usage.

### System Requirements

Here are the main tools and runtimes that I used to develop this project locally

```
$ docker -v # Docker version 17.12.0-ce (or greater)

$ docker-compose -v # docker-compose version 1.18.0

$ node -v # v8.1.2, or latest

$ python3 --version # Python 3.6.5, or Py3+
```

### Usage and Installation

From terminal, pull down this repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mottaquikarim/locutus
```

Then, assuming docker is running:

```
$ make test
```

Will build app and run (essentially nonexistent) tests.

### Secrets

Secrets are managed through environment variables, fed in via CI (Travis) or manually exported in local environment. To run deployment and/or ftest in local environment, first export all env variables as defined in `envvars.sample`. **NOTE**: the app's Dockerfiles copy `envvars.sample` to `envvars`, which is used for container builds. 


### Deployment

Serverless Framework is used to handle deployment. Look at [Serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/) getting started guide. 

Assuming `~/.aws/credentials` are exported to your envirnonment, simply run:

```
$ make clean deploy stage=dev
```

Note that `stage` is a concept from AWS Lambda, it can be any arbitrary value (which will be reflected in the deployed lambda url, it is used mainly to segment environments).

If you don't have `~/.aws/credentials` folder or are not sure why it is needed, please take a look at [these docs](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/).

[Serverless Framework Alexa Skills conf](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/alexa-skill/)

The way to allocate the skills ref to a lambda function has changed and may potentially change again in the future.

[sucks](https://github.com/mottaquikarim/sucks) 

Sucks is a great wrapper for XMPP protocol for communicating with the [EcoVac DeeBot N79S](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077HW9XM7/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Had to fork to pull in a change that has not yet been merged to master but is necessary to properly authenticate with the bot.

Had some trouble getting the vac to initialyl connect to wifi network.

[Alexa Smart Home Skill Example)(https://github.com/alexa/alexa-smarthome/blob/master/sample_lambda/python/lambda.py)

This starter was super helpful towards understanding how to set up the Alexa Smart Home skill. This [tutorial](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-smarthome/wiki/Build-a-Working-Smart-Home-Skill-in-15-Minutes) was a bit much (and a little outdated) but enough to get started.

Also, official [AWS docs](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smarthome/steps-to-build-a-smart-home-skill.html#configure-the-smart-home-service-endpoint) for this.
